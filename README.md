 # Reference 
 https://github.com/arthepsy/CVE-2021-4034/blob/main/cve-2021-4034-poc.c
 
 https://linux.die.net/man/1/pkexec
 
 
 man_page/pkexec:
 
  
       Note that pkexec does no validation of the ARGUMENTS passed to PROGRAM.
       In the normal case (where administrator authentication is required
       every time pkexec is used), this is not a problem since if the user is
       an administrator he might as well just run pkexec bash to get root.

       However, if an action is used for which the user can retain
       authorization (or if the user is implicitly authorized), such as with
       pk-example-frobnicate above, this could be a security hole. Therefore,
       as a rule of thumb, programs for which the default required
       authorization is changed, should never implicitly trust user input
       (e.g. like any other well-written suid program).
